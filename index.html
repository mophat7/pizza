                    <h2>Outside Catering</h2>
                    <p>Rather than make food hidden away in some kitchen and try to deliver it to you in a timely fashion so it does not get cold, we bring the kitchen to you and cook right in front of you. Our trailer can be pulled to your home, your office, your wedding rehearsal, or to an outdoor festival. We do all prepping outside so that you can watch your pizza being made from start to finish. It takes our crew less than five minutes to make your pizza. Did we mention the oven the cooks at over 800 degrees? BE WARNED: PTR's is the hottest fire in town, so be careful. Our pizzas are delivered straight out of the oven to you and they will be HOT!
